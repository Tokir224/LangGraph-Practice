I booked and paid for a flight to Anchorage, Alaska on **July 14, 2019** (Flight **AA1234**, Ticket # 789456123). I’m writing to request a **full refund** for the entire ticket price. I understand this is an unusual request given the time that has passed, but due to unforeseen circumstances (see below) I believe a full refund is justified. I appreciate your help in resolving this promptly. Thank you.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Support**:  \\nHello Harrison, thank you for reaching out. We’re sorry to hear you’re having an issue. Could you please provide us with the following details so we can review your case?  \\n1. The reason for your refund request.  \\n2. Any documentation you have (medical records, invoices, etc.).  \\n3. Your contact information and preferred method of payment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Harrison**:  \\nAbsolutely. I was traveling to visit my mother, who was hospitalized in Anchorage with a severe heart condition on the day of my flight. Unfortunately, due to the sudden nature of her illness, I had to cancel the flight and arrange emergency transportation, which incurred additional costs. I was unable to travel at all because of the situation.  \\n\\nAttached is a copy of the hospital’s discharge summary confirming the severity of my mother’s condition on that date, as well as a copy of my credit card statement showing the ticket purchase. My contact details are:  \\n- Email: harrison@example.com  \\n- Phone: (555) 123‑4567  \\n- Preferred refund method: Original credit card (Visa ending in 9876)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Support**:  \\nThank you for providing those documents, Harrison. I’m sorry for your loss. We’ve looked into our policies and the standard refund window for canceled flights is **within 90 days** of the original travel date. Unfortunately, because your flight was on July 14, 2019, this request falls outside that window.  \\n\\nGiven the extraordinary circumstances you described, we can offer a **partial refund** covering the portion of the fare that was non-refundable, along with a **$200 travel credit** for future use. Would that be acceptable?  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Harrison**:  \\nI appreciate your consideration, but the request for a partial refund or travel credit is not sufficient. The entire fare was paid upfront, and the cancellation was due to a **life‑threatening medical emergency** involving my mother. Under the **Airline Consumer Protection Act**, passengers may be entitled to a full refund if a medical emergency prevents travel. Moreover, the **United States Department of Transportation** requires carriers to provide full compensation for flights that are cancelled or significantly delayed for medical reasons.  \\n\\nI have already incurred additional out‑of‑pocket expenses for emergency transport and accommodation. I would like a **full refund of the ticket price** of **$2,500** and coverage for the $1,200 emergency transport costs. I am willing to provide further documentation if needed.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Support**:  \\nHarrison, I understand your frustration. We are committed to customer satisfaction, and I’m escalating this to our **Legal and Compliance Department**. Please allow 3–5 business days for a final decision.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Harrison**:  \\nThank you for escalating. I expect a prompt response. I would prefer to resolve this directly without involving legal action, but I’m prepared to pursue all available avenues to obtain a full refund.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Support**:  \\nUnderstood. We’ll get back to you within the next 48 hours.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Harrison**:  \\nThank you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  \\n\\n**FINISHED**', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='eb0c2c22-a3b1-4405-a609-e417bf37dcab')]}}\n",
