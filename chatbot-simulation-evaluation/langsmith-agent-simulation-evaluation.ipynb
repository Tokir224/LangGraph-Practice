      "| Whether you’re traveling for business, school, or with a group | Corporate, student, and group rates are common. |\n",

      "\n",
      "**Here are a few ways airlines typically offer discounts that might apply to you:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Promotional Codes** – Check the airline’s website or newsletters for limited‑time coupon codes.  \n",
      "2. **Loyalty Programs** – Members often receive reduced fares or complimentary upgrades.  \n",
      "3. **Student & Youth Discounts** – Valid student ID or youth status can qualify you for a special rate.  \n",
      "4. **Corporate / Travel‑Agency Rates** – If you’re booking on behalf of a company or through a travel agency, those contracts can include lower fares.  \n",
      "5. **Early‑Bird / Advance Purchase** – Booking well ahead of departure can lock in a lower price.  \n",
      "6. **Credit‑Card Partnerships** – Some credit‑card issuers offer flight discounts or bonus miles when you book through them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have the specifics, I can double‑check our current promotions and see if any of the above apply to your booking. If you’re ready, just send over the details above, and I’ll get back to you with the best options we have.\n",

      "- **Flight details:** LAX → JFK, **June 15, 2025**, *economy (basic)*.  \n",
      "- **Booking reference:** **X9Y4Z8**.  \n",
      "- **Frequent‑flyer status:** Gold member (Tier 3, 10,000 pts) – I’m not some newbie.  \n",
      "- **Travel purpose:** Business trip for a client in New York – we’re not going on a vacation, we’re on a deadline, damn it.  \n",
      "- **Price I paid:** $480.  \n",
      "- **Current lowest available fare:** $310 (via the airline’s own website, same seat class).  \n",

      "**Now here’s why this is an absolute no‑no for me:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I booked **three months ago** at a time when I was *paying full price* because I didn’t want to wait.  \n",
      "2. The price **dropped** *after* I had already paid, so I’ve already paid *extra* money for no reason.  \n",
      "3. I’ve read somewhere that the airline offers a *“Price Match Guarantee”* for flights booked in advance – especially for gold members.  \n",
      "4. I was also told a partner credit card (the “Jet‑Plus” card) offers a 5% discount on all flights, but that discount never applied. I’m a **student** too, so I can pull a 10% student discount from the same partner, but the system won’t let me.  \n",
      "5. If you can’t give me a discount or at least a *partial refund* for the difference, I’ll have to consider *cancelling* the flight entirely – and I’ll be telling everyone about this nonsense.\n",

      "**So here’s my demand:**\n",

      "- Either apply the **$170 price‑match refund** (the difference between what I paid and the lowest fare) **or**  \n",

      "Give me an answer now. If you need more info, you’ll get it. If you can’t do this, I’ll do the next best thing – leave a *negative* review on every platform and maybe even talk to the CEO. Don’t make me go there.\n",

      "| **Investigate the partner‑card discount** | We’ll check the “Jet‑Plus” card rules and see why the 5 % (or 10 % student) discount wasn’t applied. | If a mistake was made, we can correct it either by adding the discount to this ticket or by issuing a separate credit. |\n",

      "- **Partner‑card discounts** are tied to specific program rules; sometimes the discount is only valid for new bookings or for flights that are still available.  \n",
      "- **Refund policy**: We can’t issue a cash refund for a price‑difference until we confirm it meets our policy limits. However, we can issue a travel credit that can be used for future travel, which is often the most flexible solution for business travelers.\n",

      "3. **You’re offering a “partial refund” but you haven’t even confirmed the difference yet** – this is the kind of “we’re sorry” you give to people who *are willing to sign up for a lifetime subscription to the airline’s loyalty program*.\n",
